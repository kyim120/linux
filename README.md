🧠 Internship Plan: Build a Chatbot in C++ (Team-Based, 4 Weeks)
Daily Time Commitment: 5 hours  
Weekly Schedule: Monday–Friday (Saturday & Sunday off)  
Team Size: 2 interns (collaborative tasks)

---

📅 Week 1: C++ Foundations + Chatbot Planning
Goal: Learn C++ basics, understand chatbot logic, and plan the project

| Day | Task | How They’ll Do It |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Mon | 🔧 Setup & Tools | Install VS Code, compiler (GCC), GitHub. Learn how to compile and run C++ programs. |
| Tue | 🧠 C++ Basics | Practice variables, data types, input/output. Build a simple program together (e.g., calculator). |
| Wed | 🔁 Control Flow | Use if, else, switch, and loops. Create a mini quiz game using decision logic. |
| Thu | 📦 Functions | Write reusable functions. Each intern codes 2 functions and integrates them into a shared file. |
| Fri | 🧠 Chatbot Planning | Define chatbot scope (greetings, FAQs). Draw flowchart and write pseudocode together. |

📅 Week 2: Core Chatbot Development
Goal: Build chatbot logic using rule-based responses and modular functions

| Day | Task | How They’ll Do It |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Mon | 🧩 Input Handling | Use getline(cin, input) to capture full user messages. Test with sample inputs. |
| Tue | 🔁 Rule-Based Responses | Implement getResponse(string input) using if-else or switch. Handle 10+ keywords. |
| Wed | 🧱 Modularization | Create ChatBot class with methods like listen(), respond(), and log(). Divide class responsibilities. |
| Thu | 📂 Logging | Implement file I/O to save user inputs and bot replies in chatlog.txt. Each intern builds one file module. |
| Fri | 🧪 Testing & Debugging | Test chatbot with various inputs. Swap code for peer review and fix bugs together.

📅 Week 3: Advanced Features + API Readiness
Goal: Make chatbot smarter, modular, and ready for future API integration

| Day | Task | How They’ll Do It |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Mon | 🧠 Keyword Matching | Use find() or basic string parsing to match partial inputs. Handle unknown inputs gracefully. |
| Tue | 🎨 CLI Interface | Design a clean terminal interface with prompts, menus, and formatting. |
| Wed | 🔌 API Placeholder | Create callGameniAPI(string input) function that simulates an API call. Use dummy responses. |
| Thu | 📄 Config File | Build config.txt to toggle between local and API mode. Use file I/O to read settings. |
| Fri | 🧪 Integration Testing | Test chatbot in both modes. Log results, fix bugs, and prepare for final build.

📅 Week 4: Final Build + Presentation Prep
Goal: Polish chatbot, document it, and prepare for web integration

| Day | Task | How They’ll Do It |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Mon | 🧱 Final Integration | Merge all modules. Ensure chatbot runs smoothly with full logic and UI. |
| Tue | 📄 Documentation | Write README explaining features, usage, and logic. Include screenshots or diagrams. |
| Wed | 🎥 Demo Creation | Record a short video or create slides. Practice explaining the project clearly. |
| Thu | 🌐 GitHub Upload | Learn Git basics. Upload project, write commit messages, and share link. |
| Fri | 🧠 Web Integration Prep | Discuss how chatbot can be exposed via REST API or sockets. Plan next steps for web apps.

🧰 Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| main.cpp | Entry point, handles user input and bot responses |
| ChatBot.h / ChatBot.cpp | Class with core chatbot logic |
| chatlog.txt | Stores conversation history |
| config.txt | Toggles between local and API mode |
| GameniAPI.cpp | Placeholder for future API integration |
