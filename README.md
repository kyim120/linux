📘 Active and Passive Voice (Easy Notes)

1. Introduction

In English, we can express a sentence in two ways:

Active Voice → The subject does the action.

Passive Voice → The subject receives the action.



---

2. Active Voice

Focuses on who is doing the action.

Structure: Subject + Verb + Object


Examples:

Ali writes a letter.

The teacher teaches English.



---

3. Passive Voice

Focuses on the receiver of the action.

Structure: Object + Be (is/was/has been etc.) + Past Participle + by + Subject


Examples:

A letter is written by Ali.

English is taught by the teacher.



---

4. Rules of Changing Active into Passive

(a) Identify the Object

The object of the active sentence becomes the subject in passive.


Example:

Active: She helps me.

Passive: I am helped by her.



---

(b) Use Correct Form of “Be” + Past Participle

Present Simple → am/is/are + V3

Past Simple → was/were + V3

Future Simple → will be + V3

Present Continuous → am/is/are being + V3

Past Continuous → was/were being + V3

Present Perfect → has/have been + V3

Past Perfect → had been + V3

Modal (can, should, must) → modal + be + V3

(c) Examples by Tense

Present Simple	Ali writes a letter.	A letter is written by Ali.
Past Simple	She cleaned the room.	The room was cleaned by her.
Future Simple	He will buy a car.	A car will be bought by him.

(d) When “By” is Not Used

If the subject is unknown or not important, we often skip “by”.


Examples:

Active: Someone stole my bag.

Passive: My bag was stolen.

Active: People speak English worldwide.

Passive: English is spoken worldwide.
