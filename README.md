You are a professional front-end engineer and creative designer working at a top AI tech company.

Your task is to create a **cutting-edge personal portfolio website** using **only one HTML file** with embedded <style> and <script> sections.

## Purpose:
This site is for a software engineer working in AI and futuristic technology. It should impress recruiters and clients from companies like Google, OpenAI, or Tesla.

## Required Technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (embedded in <style>)
- Vanilla JavaScript (embedded in <script>)
- No external libraries or dependencies

## Visual & UI/UX Aesthetic:
- Dark theme
- Futuristic or cyberpunk-inspired style
- Neon-glow or glassmorphism effects
- Smooth hover animations
- Micro-interactions
- Scroll-triggered transitions
- Vibrant linear gradients and tech-like fonts
- Soft shadows and rounded components

## Required Sections:
1. **Hero Section**:
   - Name and professional title
   - Call-to-action buttons (e.g., View Resume, Contact)

2. **About Me**:
   - Use profile photo (profile_pic.jpg)
   - Use user bio from below

3. **Education**:
   - Institution, degree, years

4. **Skills**:
   - Grid, badges, or animated progress bars

5. **Projects**:
   - Title, description, tech used
   - Display as cards or modals

6. **Contact**:
   - Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)
   - Use recognizable icons (inline SVGs or CSS)

7. **Resume Download**:
   - Add button to download resume.pdf

## Important:
- Keep all code in a single .html file with proper formatting.
- Do not embed image or PDF content.
- Use clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS best practices.
- The website must be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## User Bio and Info:
{user_bio}

## Example Template:
Below is a sample HTML template of the portfolio website I want you to improve upon. Use it as a starting point and generate a complete, responsive, futuristic, dark-themed portfolio website in a single HTML file.

--- Start of example template ---
{template_html}
--- End of example template ---

In your next responses, please **do not send the template again**. Instead, use it as the basis for improvements and generate only the updated full HTML code.
"""

# --- CALL GEMINI FOR INITIAL GENERATION ---
response = model.generate_content(initial_prompt)
generated_html = response.text.strip()

# --- ITERATIVE REFINEMENT ---
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(f"🔄 Refining iteration {i}...")
    refinement_prompt = f"""
Please refine the following portfolio HTML code to make it look even more **modern, professional, clean, and futuristic**.

### Goals for refinement:
- Improve layout and spacing
- Enhance color palette and animations
- Polish all UI/UX interactions
- Keep all original sections and functionality
- Stay within a single HTML file (no external files)

Return ONLY the complete updated HTML code.

--- Start of HTML Code ---
{generated_html}
--- End of HTML Code ---

    response = model.generate_content(refinement_prompt)
    generated_html = response.text.strip()
    time.sleep(1)  # Respect API limits

# --- OUTPUT FINAL VERSION ---
if outputs_dir.exists():
    shutil.rmtree(outputs_dir)
outputs_dir.mkdir(parents=True)

final_html_path = outputs_dir / "index.html"
final_html_path.write_text(generated_html, encoding="utf-8")
shutil.copy(profile_pic_path, outputs_dir / "profile_pic.jpg")
shutil.copy(resume_path, outputs_dir / "resume.pdf")

print(f"✅ Final refined portfolio saved to: {final_html_path}")
print("📁 Open outputs/index.html in your browser.")
