📘 Direct and Indirect Speech (Easy Notes)

1. Introduction

When we report someone’s words, we can do it in two ways:

Direct Speech → using the speaker’s exact words.

Indirect Speech → reporting the meaning of the words, not the exact wording.



---

2. Direct Speech

In Direct Speech, we put the exact words of the speaker inside quotation marks (" ").

A comma separates the reporting verb from the quoted words.


Example:

Ali said, “I am tired.”

She asked, “Where are you going?”



---

3. Indirect Speech

In Indirect Speech, we report the speaker’s words without quotation marks.

We often change the tense, pronouns, and words like this/that, now/then, today/yesterday.


Example:

Ali said that he was tired.

She asked where I was going.

4. Rules of Changing Direct to Indirect Speech

(a) Changes in Pronouns

First person (I, we) → changes according to the subject of reporting verb.

Second person (you) → changes according to the object of reporting verb.

Third person (he, she, they) → usually remains the same.


Example:

He said, “I am happy.” → He said that he was happy.



---

(b) Changes in Tenses (when Reporting Verb is in Past)

Present Simple → Past Simple

Present Continuous → Past Continuous

Present Perfect → Past Perfect

Past Simple → Past Perfect

Will/Shall → Would/Should


Example:

She said, “I eat apples.” → She said that she ate apples.

He said, “I will go.” → He said that he would go.



---

(c) Changes in Time and Place Words

now → then

today → that day

tomorrow → the next day

yesterday → the previous day

here → there

this → that

these → those


Example:

He said, “I will go tomorrow.” → He said that he would go the next day.



---

(d) For Questions

No question mark in Indirect Speech.

Use asked, inquired, wanted to know.

Question form changes to normal sentence order (Subject + Verb).


Examples:

Direct: She asked, “Where are you going?”

Indirect: She asked where I was going.

Direct: He said, “Do you like tea?”

Indirect: He asked if I liked tea.



---

(e) For Commands/Requests

Use told, ordered, requested, advised, asked + infinitive (to + verb).


Examples:

Direct: He said, “Close the door.”

Indirect: He told me to close the door.

Direct: She said, “Please help me.”

Indirect: She requested me to help her.
